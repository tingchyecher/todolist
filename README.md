●  	What did you like about this project?

Gives us a good understanding/practice on back-end setup.  Rectifying errors so that connections are working both on database and display.

●  	What did you struggle with in this project?

Conditions for date comparison.  Date formats are different for input.value and database format.

I believe we need to split the date into day/month/year parts and compare?

●  	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

More practice and better understanding of the linkages of the Spring Boot MVC architecture.
